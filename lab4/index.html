	Stand facing each other
	Both players make a fist with one hand

     On “Shoot,” both players reveal one of the three hand signs:
      
	 Rock = closed fist

	  Scissors = two fingers (like a V)
      
    See who won:
      
	Rock crushes Scissors

	Paper covers Rock

     If both players choose the same sign, it's a tie (go again)

    Have fun and play fair!
