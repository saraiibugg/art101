						<p> My name is Saraí, and I'm a third year sociology major with some computer programming skills.
						I am very excited to learn more throughout the course and further my knowledge in coding.</p>
						In my freetime I like to go to the gym, hike, and roller skate at the skate park.
							I have a siamase flamepoint named clover who I love very much and is the silliest goose ever!</p>
							My partner is Devika Subramaniam and she enjoys listening to mainstream pop and R&B. 
							Devika also enjoys to paint in her free time and go on walks with her dog Sophie.</p>
						Also a fun fact I learned about Devika is that she is a twin!</p>
