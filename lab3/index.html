			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We are supposed to create a local file structure on our computer and add index.html files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
						I found it easy to create the file structure but had a difficult time creating index.html files and making sure they showed up live on my website. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am going to make sure I double check when I code to make sure I didn't forget anything, because that seems to be my biggest issue when it comes to coding. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> We were able to succefully create a file structure and this is the index.html file I created: </p>
					<img class="filestructure" src="../lab3/img/imgfilestructure.png">
