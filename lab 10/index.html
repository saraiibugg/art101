					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner we are supposed to experiment with modifying the dom.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was more difficult than lab 9 but I was able to use the knowledge and information I learned in class to help me complete the lab. My biggest issue was coming up with responses, debugging, and making sure everything worked. Learning how to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM and apply styles dynamically was also a bit tricky at first.</p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflections">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I found this lab to be alot more time consuming just because of the amount of buttons but it was still very fun to do.</p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Click the "Say Something" button to see my results</p>
