					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a webpage from scratch called "hello world" with a paragraph talking about ourselves and our partner. Then we use CSS to style and make the webpage look pretty </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems that arose for me was trying to remember to correctly add a tag and make sure not to forget anything while working with CSS.
						I kept forgetting to add certain things such as semicolons, which caused me to not see some of the changes I was trying to create.
						Luckily my partner was very helpful, and was able to help me fix/find my mistakes.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Reflecting back on this assignment, I found it to be very fun and easy once I understood and got the hang of it.
						At first starting was rough and difficult. I struggle a bit, especially when it came to CSS but after I grassped my head around it, I started to enjoy myself and working on my website.
